> Easy Zero-Knowledge Inference

[![Test](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl/actions?query=workflow%3ARust)

`ezkl` is a library and command-line tool for doing inference for deep learning models and other computational graphs in a zk-snark (ZKML). It enables the following workflow:

1. Define a computational graph, for instance a neural network (but really any arbitrary set of operations), as you would normally in pytorch or tensorflow.
2. Export the final graph of operations as an [.onnx](https://onnx.ai/) file and some sample inputs to a `.json` file.
3. Point `ezkl` to the `.onnx` and `.json` files to generate a ZK-SNARK circuit with which you can prove statements such as:
> "I ran this publicly available neural network on some private data and it produced this output"

> "I ran my private neural network on some public data and it produced this output"

> "I correctly ran this publicly available neural network on some public data and it produced this output"

In the backend we use [Halo2](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/halo2) as a proof system.

## Getting Started ‚öôÔ∏è

### building the project üî®
Note that the library requires a nightly version of the rust toolchain. You can change the default toolchain by running:

```bash
rustup override set nightly
```

After which you may build the library

```bash
cargo build --release
```

A folder `./target/release` will be generated. Add this folder to your PATH environment variable to call `ezkl` from the CLI.

```bash
# For UNIX like systems
# in .bashrc, .bash_profile, or some other path file
export PATH="<replace with where you cloned the repo>/ezkl/target/release:$PATH"
```

Restart your shell or reload your shell settings

```bash
# example, replace .bash_profile with the file you use to configure your shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

You will need a functioning installation of `solc` in order to run `ezkl` properly.
[solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select) is recommended.
Follow the instructions on [solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select) to activate `solc` in your environment.
